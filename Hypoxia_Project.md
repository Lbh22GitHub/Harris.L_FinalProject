Hypoxia in Hood Canal
Logan B. Harris
I did research and created plots to visualize the the trend of dissolved oxygen concentration with depth and location in Hood Canal in Washington.
I went into this project expecting to see a decrease in dissolved oxygen concentration as you moved south. 
I created a depth profile and contour plots to compare dissolved oxygen conc. at different locations which confirmed my prediction.
